# Tahinix

A test runner to learn about meta-programming in elixir

Idea source from [here](https://projectbook.code.brettchalupa.com/libraries/unit-testing-lib.html)
Inspiration from RSpec and Mix test.

Further, I also use concepts from Chris McCord's [Metaprogramming in Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/cmelixir/metaprogramming-elixir) 

Full breakdown of the thought process can be found [here](./docs/tahinix.md)
